Explanation

1) Data Input: Replace the strain and stress arrays with your actual data.
2) Plot Stress-Strain Curve: The code plots the stress-strain curve.
3) Modulus of Elasticity (E): The modulus of elasticity is calculated from the initial linear portion of the curve.
4) Yield Strength: The yield strength is calculated using the 0.2% offset method. An offset line is plotted and the yield strength is identified where the stress-strain curve intersects this line.
5) Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS): The maximum stress value is identified as the ultimate tensile strength.
6) Annotations: Yield strength and UTS points are annotated on the plot.

Replace the sample data with your actual stress-strain data for accurate analysis.
